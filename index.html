   <h3>What is Bread?</h3>
   <p>
      Bread is a new text editor currently in HEAVY development. It aims to be efficient, extensive, and customizable.
   </p>
   <h3>Why should I be excited/What sets Bread apart?</h3>
   <p>
      While there are many great text editors out there right now, Bread seeks to improve upon some areas where others fall short.
      <ol>
	 <li>
	    <h4>Customizability</h4>
	    <p>
	       Bread aims to be essentially completely customizable through plugins and themes. The default user-interface, Rye, is written in the lovely Qt framework, allowing for a beautiful cross-platform GUI. However, if so desired, another front-end could be written for Bread, since Bread is actually just a server. Which brings us to our next point.
	    </p>
	 </li>
	 <li>
	    <h4>Collaboration</h4>
	    <p>
	       Since Bread is actually just the server which is completely separate from the GUI, you can connect multiple GUIs to one running instance of Bread and collaborate easily.
	    </p>
	 </li>
	 <li>
	    <h4>Efficiency</h4>
	    <p>
	       Bread is being designed from the ground up to be as efficient as possible. This means that Bread is fast and responsive.
	    </p>
	 </li>
	 <li>
	    <h4>Fun!</h4>
	    <p>
	       Using and developing Bread is supposed to be an enjoyable experience. We are doing our best to ensure that Bread is fun to use.
